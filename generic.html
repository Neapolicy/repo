									<h1><br />
									projects in depth</h1>
									<p>Although I have more projects beyond these<br />
									I believe that these four are the most presentable projects I have<br />
									However, my older projects can be found on my Github.</p>

								<h2>C-Side Venture</h2>
								<p>My first fully fleshed out game, for this game, I was able to commission an artist to make all the assets for me, which led to the game’s graphics being all original except for the background. I also used a proper game engine to develop this game, and it was through this project that taught me how to use the game engine. Overall, this was my first experience in developing a proper game.
								</p>
								<h2>Pothole Simulator</h2>
								<p>This was my very first game that I made that was not a terminal app, while the game itself is extremely short, being only a few minutes long, it was vital in teaching me the do’s and don’ts of game development, furthermore, I challenged myself by making this game without the use of a game engine, which did lead to some problems, but it also lead me to realize the importance of using a game engine for game development.</p>
								<h2>Horror Parody</h2>
								<p>After I made C-Side Venture, I decided to try and challenge myself by making a 3d game, furthermore, I wanted to try and keep most of the assets original, which I was able to accomplish near the beginning. However, due to burnout from making the models, I eventually started to use pre-made models from the internet, but I ended up scrapping this game in large part due to the severe burnout I got from making this game.
								</p>
								<h2>Boss Rush</h2>
								<p>The current project that I am working on, due to the burnout that I had from trying to make the 3D game, I decided to step back and try and make something simple, something that I am familiar with, I also decided to go easier on myself by allowing me to reuse any assets that I previously made and also to use other sprites from the internet. Overall, I’m making this game both for practice and fun.
